Here is my React demo. It's a simple madlib-style app, and should be pretty self-explanatory. The default text is from Snoopy's novel - I was crunched for time and couldn't think of anything better. I hope you have fun with it!

I used Jest for the tests. I'm pretty new to Jest, but it comes built in with create-react-app, so I decided to go with it.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
